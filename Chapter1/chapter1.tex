%********************************** %First Section  **************************************
Percolation is one of the most studied problems in statistical physics. Its idea was first conceived by Paul Flory in the early 1940s in the context of gelation in polymers. Later, in 1957 it acquires the mathematical formulation due to the work of engineer Simon Broadbent and mathematician John Hammersley. Ever since then percolation theory has been studied extensively by scientists in general and physicits in particular.
