	This thesis became reality only due to the immense support of many individuals. First I would like to convey my sincere grattitude to my mentor, my supervisor, Dr. Md. Kamrul Hassan. I want to thank you Sir for believing in me and giving me the chance that very few people would. You were always there when I needed you and I feel great honour and privilege to be able to work under your supervision. Next I want to thank my parents, Md. Azizur Rahman and Sahera Parvin, who always on supports me. I want to thank two of my senior, Digonto Islam and Nageeb Zaman. Without your help it would have been very hard to understand some of the way of looking at things differently. All those fruitful discussions we had have helped me in the course of my scientific endeavor. Finally I want to thank my friends, Anick, Jowad, Kaushik, Mahadi, Merin, Tanvir, Tauhid, Tonmoy. Your supports gives me the boost to peruse my dream.
