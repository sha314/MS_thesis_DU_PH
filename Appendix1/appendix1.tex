\chapter{Percolation} 
\section{Algorithm}
	The algorithm for RSBD is quite simple.	Take a lattice of length $L$. It will contain $L^2$ frozen sites and $2L^2$ bond which are always present according to the new definition of site percolation. Then follow only option from below:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[L0] pick a site randomly and then occupy it if the site is unoccupied and continue this process \ref{fig:L0-interaction}.
		
		\item[L1] pick a site randomly and then occupy it if the site is unoccupied and if it is already occupied choose one of the four neighbors to occupy. If the neighbors are unoccupied then occupy them else skip current iteration and  continue this process \ref{fig:L1-interaction}.
		
		\item[L2]  pick a site randomly and then occupy it if the site is unoccupied and if it is already occupied choose one of the four neighbors to occupy. If the neighbors are unoccupied then occupy them else choose the site next to the first selected neighbor to occupy. If the 2nd selected neighbor is unoccupied then occupy it else skip current iteration and  continue this process \ref{fig:L2-interaction}.
	\end{enumerate}

\section{Code}
	
	Each header file starts with a directive \textit{\#ifndef} and \textit{\#define}, which is necessary because one header file is needed multiple times and including it more than once results in error. These directive prevents it. Of course this directive must be closed by \textit{\#endif}.
	
	
	\subsection{Index}
	Here the notion of index of site and index of bond is defined. Site index has two element which determine row and column. Bond Index had three element describing bond type, row, column. Bond type can be horizontal or vertical.
	\input{Appendix1/codes/index}	
	
	
	\subsection{Site}
	The site class contains all information about a site, e.g., if it is active or not and if it is then what is it's group id or relative index.
	\input{Appendix1/codes/site}
	
	\subsection{Bond}
	The bond class contains all information about a bond, e.g., if it is active or not and if it is then what is it's group id.
	\input{Appendix1/codes/bond}
			
	\subsection{Lattice}
	The lattice class consists of array of sites and bonds. This class contains information about lattice size. And contains functions to view the lattice differently in the console.
	\input{Appendix1/codes/lattice}
	
	\subsection{Exception}
	Different types of exceptions.
	\input{Appendix1/codes/exception}
	
	\subsection{Cluster}
	The cluster class contains all information about a cluster. Number of sites and bonds in a cluster and the id of the cluster is contained in a cluster.
	\input{Appendix1/codes/cluster}
	
	\subsection{Percolation}
	The \textit{SqLatticePercolation} class contains generic operation that to performed for percolation on square lattice. It's subclass  \textit{SitePercolation\_ps\_v9} is the class when all required method for general site percolation with our definition is defined. 
	And it's subclass \textit{SitePercolationBallisticDeposition\_v2}
	contains some method for ballistic deposition for $l=\{1,2\}$ which extends to two new subclass \textit{SitePercolationBallisticDeposition\_L1\_v2} and \textit{SitePercolationBallisticDeposition\_L2\_v2} with detailed method for ballistic deposition $l=1$ and $l=2$ respectively.
	
	\input{Appendix1/codes/percolation}
	\input{Appendix1/codes/site-percolation}
	
	\subsection{Utilities}
	We sometimes need to print an array, std::map, std::vector in the console. Some functions for this task is given here. 
	\input{Appendix1/codes/printer}
	
	When generating data file we need to name our data file uniquely so that when all of the data files are in one location, no confusion occurs. A good way to do this is to add the time and data stamp at the end of each data file. Although data filename does share a common pattern.
	\input{"Appendix1/codes/time_tracking"}
	\input{Appendix1/codes/type}
	
	\subsection{Tests}
	A template function is required to run for $l0, l1, l2$. The template argument is the class name. The other two argument is the length and ensemble size we need for one file. The three template arguments are
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item SitePercolation\_ps\_v9
		\item SitePercolationBallisticDeposition\_L1\_v2
		\item SitePercolationBallisticDeposition\_L1\_v2
	\end{enumerate}
	\input{Appendix1/codes/test}
	
	\subsection{Main}
	The main function receives 3 additional command line argument. First one is an integer $l\in\{0,1,2\}$ which determine the range of interaction. Second one is the length of the lattice. And third one is the size of the ensemble. For example, $1 200 5000$ will run the program for $l=1$, $L=200$ for ensemble size of $5000$.
	
	The \textit{run\_in\_main(int, char**)} function is the one where the  \textit{simulate\_site\_percolation\_T<>(size\_t, size\_t)} executes for different classes.
	
	\input{Appendix1/codes/main}
	
	\subsection{CMakeLists}
	All the header and source files are listed here and how the compiler should link them is generated by running cmake. \url{https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/}
	
	\input{Appendix1/codes/cmakelists}
